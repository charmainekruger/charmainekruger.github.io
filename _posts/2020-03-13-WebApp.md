The past couple of months, I've been getting my hands dirty with the new Google Analytics Web+App property.
I have been waiting forever for this evolution to happen and it is finally here.

Sure, the product is still in Beta and doesn't have all the capabilities that Universal Google Analytics currently has.
But I challenge you to look beyond the limitations of the Beta product and start thinking about how awesome it will be to do like for like 
reporting between your website and your app.
